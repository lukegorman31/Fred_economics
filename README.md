# Fred_economics
Small project where I pulled data from the FRED database via an API and visualised the data.

This was a small personal project where I pulled data from the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED). 
I pulled datasets for unemployment, inflation and house price index and merged them all into a single data frame.

This involved some cleaning and transforming data. 

I also made 5 visuals using the plotly package. Below are some examples. 

![Unemployment](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116017484/217797298-2ac8744a-529a-4a09-92a1-bd8710bb92d7.png)
Above is the unemployment figures in the US over a period of 20 years. 
It is interesting to observe the sharp increase in 2020 which coincides the Coivd-19 Pandemic and the rise in unemployment after the 2008 crash.

Here is the home price index over time represented as a bar chart from 1985 all the way to 2023.

This final plot is an example of plotting two different economic indicators on the same line chart.
