# Fred_economics
Small project where I pulled data from the FRED database via an API and visualised the data.

This was a small personal project where I pulled data from the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED). 
I pulled datasets for unemploymnet, inflation and house price index and merged them all into a single data frame.

I also made 5 visuals using the plotly package.
